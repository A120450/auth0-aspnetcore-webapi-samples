# Seed Project for the ASP.NET Core Web API Quickstart

This seed project can be used if you want to follow along with the steps in the [ASP.NET Core Web API Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/aspnet-core-webapi/v1).

This starter seed is a basic web API application which was created using the Yeoman generator for ASP.NET, and also includes  the dependencies required to use the JWT middleware.

## To run this project

```bash
dotnet restore

dotnet run
```

Then go to `http://localhost:3010/api/public` in Postman (or your web browser) to access the ping API endpoint.
